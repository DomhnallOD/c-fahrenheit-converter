# Temperature Converter
A concise C program which converts a user-input Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and Kelvin, and outputs the results.

## Purpose
This program demonstrates function prototyping, I/O, simple float arithmetic, decimal formatting, constants and conditional if-else statements.
This code was written as part of my strategy to learn C/C++ in order to develop embedded systems. 

Materials studied include *C Primer Plus (6th ed.)* by Stephen Prata, and W3Schools C tutorial series (w3schools.in/c-tutorial)
